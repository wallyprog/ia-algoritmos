/**
 * Random forest for classification. Random forest is an ensemble classifier
 * that consists of many decision trees and outputs the majority vote of
 * individual trees. The method combines bagging idea and the random
 * selection of features.
 * <p>
 * Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:
 * <ol>
 * <li> If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
 * with replacement from the original data. This sample will
 * be the training set for growing the tree. 
 * <li> If there are M input variables, a number m &lt;&lt; M is specified such
 * that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
 * the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
 * held constant during the forest growing. 
 * <li> Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning. 
 * </ol>
 * The advantages of random forest are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.
 * <li> It runs efficiently on large data sets.
 * <li> It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
 * <li> It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.
 * <li> It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
 * as the forest building progresses.
 * <li> It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
 * accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.
 * </ul>
 * The disadvantages are
 * <ul>
 * <li> Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
 * even more pronounced on noisy data.
 * <li> For data including categorical variables with different number of
 * levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
 * levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are
 * not reliable for this type of data.
 * </ul>
